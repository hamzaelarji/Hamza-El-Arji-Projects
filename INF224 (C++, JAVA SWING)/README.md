This repository serves as the project report for the INF224 course at Telecom Paris, focusing on Programming Paradigms and honing Java and C++ programming skills. (course website : https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/elc/inf224/)

## About the Application

The project's objective was to develop a multimedia set-top box software capable of displaying photos, playing music, videos, and films. The application comprises both backend and frontend components.

- The frontend aspect entails creating a remote control interface for the set-top box, implemented using Java/Swing for graphical user interfaces.
- The backend component is crafted using C++.

## How to Run the Application

To execute the application, follow these steps:

1. Open two terminals, allocating one for the frontend and the other for the backend.
2. Compile and run each part separately.


### For backend :
```
cd cpp
make
make run myprog
```

### For frontend :
```
cd swing
make
make run
```
